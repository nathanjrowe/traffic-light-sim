 *
 * This program is a simple game that allows the user to interact and shoot the targets by typing
 * the word on screen correctly.
 * I went a bit above the spec of the program and made about twice the amount of classes given as starters
 * and I also made 2 new game modes.
 * There is the speed shooter scene and the 3D key shooter scene.
 * I made a scene controller class that controls which scenes are displayed.
