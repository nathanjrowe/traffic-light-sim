I just finished up the comments for each of the code sections, most of the classes had significant overlap
next time writing something like this it would be best to use a parent "vehicle" class with more specific
"bus" "car" and "person" classes inherriting all of the common methods. If a 2d and 3d version of these parent
classes were made it would allow an expansion of the types and behaviors of vehicles.

TrafficCarCreation.java
and
TrafficPedestrian.java
are both old versions of the vehicle and person classes and should have been removed.

The decision to use Camera.java and MathUtils.java was odd, these both add very little to the overall project,
in particular MathUtils.java wasn't used at all except for a single simple math function, and that was only called
in Camera.java.

Another way to improve the code could be to set the background map onto a grid system and fit each intersection component
in based on a double for loop that increments the distance between each intersection by some fixed amount.
An alternative could be to create whole "blocks" of neighborhoods as modular sections and add them in some set or randomized
pattern to create a city simulation.
